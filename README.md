## Introduction
This project is for a Travis CI Seminar. 

The project includes a very simple **Calculator webapp**. 

> For unit testing, we use mocha. 

> For functional testing, we use a testing tool called Cypress. Its tests are written in javascript, hence it is very easy for frontend developers to adopt.

The main purpose - demoing how to integrate these testing tools with Travis CI - is rather simple. The following will explain briefly about CI, what we do in the project and then how to use Travis CI.

## Continuous Integration and Travis CI in brief
**Continuous Integration** is the practice of automatically building and testing code changes of each commit, providing immediate feedback on the testing outcome. This way, every time a commit cause problems we'll get notified and be able to react quickly to deal those problems.

**Travis CI** docs gives us an excellent introduction to why we want to adopt the Continuous Integration practice. 
> Continuous Integration is the practice of merging in small code changes frequently - rather than merging in a large change at the end of a development cycle. The goal is to build healthier software by developing and testing in smaller increments. This is where Travis CI comes in.

**Travis CI** is simply a platform that helps us do do those things.

## Setup Project
The initial project includes a basic calculator app. The app includes a **green title**, an **input box** for users to input expressions, a **button** to trigger calculation and an **textbox for displaying results**.

## Unit Tests using Mocha
One unit test tests if calculator calculate 1+2 correctly (```calculator.test.js```).

## Functional Test using Cypress
Including 2 tests (in ```./cypress/integration/index_spec.js```): 
- One checking if the app contains a green title saying "Hello Calculatee!! !!!". 
- The other one tests the whole scenario in which a user types into the "Expression" input box "1+2+3+4", clicks the "Evaluation expression" button to see if the correct result appears in the "Result" textbox.

## Get started with Travis CI
1. Use your Github account to sign in Travis-ci.org (for public repositories).
2. Once youâ€™re signed in to Travis CI, it synchronizes your GitHub repositories, then you go to your profile page and enable the repository you want to use CI.
3. Add a ```.travis.yml``` file to your repository to tell Travis CI what to do.

```yml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - 8
cache:
  directories:
    - ~/.npm
    - node_modules
install:
  - npm install
before_script:
  - npm start &
  - sleep 4
```

The above is our project's yml file. It tells Travis CI to install NodeJs, caching folder ```~/.npm``` and folder ```node_modules```. Then run ```npm install``` to install all dependencies. The ```before_script``` tells Travis CI what to do before running test script which we have configured in ```package.json``` file. Here, we want it to first start the app in parallel and wait a little bit.

4. Commit and push the ```.travis.yml``` file, Travis CI will check for that file and trigger the CI process.

5. Visit the build status page to check if your build passes or fails.
